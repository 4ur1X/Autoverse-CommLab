                  <p class="content">A limited production high performance sports car for sports-driving lovers manufactured by Lamborghini. The Veneno is Lamborghini’s interpretation of a racing prototype built for the road. There is no doubt that the jet-like Veneno will be a future classic as it is already one of most desired Lamborghinis ever built. The wild design of the Lamborghini Veneno Roadster was designated to shape the Italian’s brand future and is a significant milestone in the Lamborghini’s history.</p>

                  <p class="content">Ferrari's most ambitious project and first ever production car to be equipped with the F1-derived hybrid solution. LaFerrari is the first full hybrid produced by the Italian automotive marque, providing the highest power output of any Ferrari road car whilst decreasing fuel consumption by 40 percent. The LaFerrari is the most extreme road-going Ferrari ever made. (The LaFerrari-based FXX K is more ridiculous, but it's restricted to track duty.) Only 499 LaFerraris will ever exist.</p>

                  <h3>$215,500</h3>
                  <p class="content">It's a McLaren all right, but the aim is to take the ground from underneath rivals' front-engined GTs. McLaren fits the GT with a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that generates 612 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque. It's paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the rear wheels. Is the McLaren GT fast?
